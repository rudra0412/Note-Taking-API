# Note-Taking-API

You don't need anything extra for setting up this project on local. I have already allowed all the IP addresses to access the mongodb-project.
Just clone the project and run "npm run serve" in the terminal.

Swagger-ui link after setting up on local: http://localhost:3000/api-docs
